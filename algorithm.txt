In order for a packet to be seen, it must pass the kernel filter.

When the packet is read by chox, its put at the tail of the running queue.
As the packets are read in, they are evaluated to see if there are "interesting"
packets.   Interesting packets much have a peer.

Packets are moved from the running queue to the pre-queue when:
   a) the running queue fills up
   b) a timeout occurs
When packets are moved from the running queue to the pre-queue, 
they are evaluated to see:
   a) are they interesting (passes the inner filter test)
   b) do they have a peer

If they are interesting and DON'T have a peer, this is a trigger event, in which case the prequeue
packets are written out along with the trigger.
